In this type of scenario the individual wants to save up to buy say a refrigerator or other household appliance but cannot find the discipline to save up for the item themselves.  A microcredit loan allows them to buy the refrigerator outright and then places them on a strict repayment schedule that commits the individual to putting aside the fraction of weekly income toward the item that they might have otherwise struggled to do on their own. \n",
