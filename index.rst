This is a rough assembly of reading and
lecture notes on development microeconomics topics all written
as interactive jupyter notebooks. The content can be read in a variety
of ways. You can read them in styled but static `webpages`_ form or
as a `PDF book`_ (via the readthedocs service) or you can run them
interactively on a `MS Azure jupyter notebook server`_ to allow
you to interact with code and widgets.  If you know
how to run your own jupyter notebook server with a python kernel you can
also just clone/download content from the github repo: https://github.com/jhconning/Dev-II

This is *very* preliminary content (most from a Spring 2016 class), much of it
quick first draft form.  Over time I'll try to improve the posted drafts.
If you spot errors or would like to suggest edits or contribute material please do
so via the github repository (start an 'issue ticket'):
