# Dev-II
 Repository for The Graduate Center's Spring [2018 Economics
 Development II PhD seminar](https://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (HTML rendered).

__Lecture and reading Notes as Jupyter Notebooks__

Click on the link above for HTML rendered content but look here for the jupyter notebooks. 

These notebooks can also now be run from the Microsoft Azure jupyter notebook server](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/DevII) which mirrors this content. See instructions below.

These jupyter notebooks expand on topics in the Microeconomics of Development. 
First developed for a Spring 2016 version of this course, many of the notebooks are still only
very rough notes. With time I hope to edit the rough ones and add new content.  

In present form this is less like a coherent sequential
collection of lecture notes and more like an idiosyncratic collection
of reading notes and materials that complement class lectures and that can be used to
explore and extend the embedded simulations and data analyses.

Viewing and interacting with content
----------------------------------------------
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) open a world of new ways for creating and sharing content that mixes text, math and code for interactive simulation and visualization. Jupyter notebooks can also be easily converted to render the content in different ways and formats (HTML, markdown, PDF, etc).

This content is now mirrored to a [Microsoft Azure Notebook library for this content](https://notebooks.azure.com/jhconning/libraries/DevII).  If you login with a free Microsoft account you can launch a cloud-based juptyer notebook server that will allow you to run any of the notebooks interactively.  Alternatively, clone this github
and run them on your own computer.

The following table describes the contents of the notebooks folders and links
to quick static views of the notebook content. If you plan to only read the content without interaction you may prefer the [HTML rendering at this site.

The course site [dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.org] has the reading list
and syllabus for the course and auto-generated styled HTML and PDF versions of
all this content (but sometimes not all repo content converts).
